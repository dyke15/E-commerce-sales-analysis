### Data Source 

Sales Data: the primary dataset use for this analysis is the "ecommerce data.xlsx" containing detailed information about each sales made by the company

### Tools 

- Excel - Data cleaning
- SQL Server - Data analysis/manipulation
- PowerBi - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performe the following tasks;
 1. Data loading and inspection.
 2. Handly missing values.
 3. Data cleaning and formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involves exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

1. Identify historical sales trends (e.g., monthly, seasonal, or annual patterns).
   
2. Highlight the top-performing product categories and assess their contribution to overall revenue.
 
3. Calculate the customer retention rate and identify the percentage of returning customers.
 
4. Pinpoint regions with high and low sales performance.
 
5. Evaluate the possible reasons behind the sales differences (e.g., demographics, logistics).
    
6. Assess how delivery status (e.g., on-time, delayed, canceled) impacts sales and customer satisfaction in various regions.
 
7. Analyze how different shipping options (e.g., standard, expedited, or same-day) influence delivery performance.
 
8. Perform customer segmentation to identify groups based on preferences, behavior, or demographics.
  
9. Discover which segments show the most interest in specific products or categories.


### Key Findings

- Sales trend analysis: identified seasonal increase in sales over the year
